# Vite + React App

This project is a Vite-based React application deployed on Netlify. It demonstrates modern frontend development practices with a focus on speed and performance.

## Project Overview

The project is a simple interactive application created using Vite and React. It serves as a foundational template for building React applications with fast development and optimized build processes.

### Live Demo

Check out the live version of the app [here](https://golden-cendol-e2d5f2.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool and development server.
- **React**: Component-based user interface library.
- **Netlify**: Easy deployment and continuous integration.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the optimized production build.
